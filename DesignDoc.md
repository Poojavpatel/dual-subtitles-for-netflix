## Introduction

This document provides an in-depth view of the technical aspects of the project.

## Goals and non-goals

### Goals

- Allow user to select subtitles in two languages from netflix UI
- Display subtitles in two different languages simultaneously on netflix content
- Subtitles should stay in sync with original subtitles on pause, play, rewind, etc
- Try avoiding any payment or account creation, should be a simple service

### Non-Goals

- UI Supporting more than 2 languages
- Ability to change design, font, size, color of the subtitles
- Support for horizontal subtitles for japanese or any other language specific edge-cases

## Future scope

## Functional and non-functional requirements

## Proposed design

The project has 4 major components

### 1. Subtitle generation

A few ways for generating subtitle data are

1.  #### Manually uploading subtitles file

    This is the simplest solution but also not scalable

1.  #### Reverse engineering netflix and using subtitles generated by netflix

    Inspect netflix source, media files, network calls, local browser and cache storage for subtitle data  
    From spike learning, this is not straightforward  
    Need to take care of permissions and security concerns

1.  #### Using a third-party service for text to speech or language translation
    From spike learning, most services have freemium model that allows free usage only for 60 mins every day  
    This wont work as the limit is very less as compared to average time spent on netflix daily

### 2. Adding dual subtitles to netflix UI

### 3. Syncing with media

### 4. Creating and publishing a chrome extension
